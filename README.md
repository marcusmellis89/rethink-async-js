# Rethink-Async-JS
A repository of concepts, examples, and exercises on the different approaches to handling the asynchronous nature of javascript
featuring:

-callbacks

-thunks

-promises

-asynchrounous sequences

-generators

-observables

-communicating sequential processes(CSP)

Scaffolding code from initial commit in this repo done by @getify. The creation and goals of this repo is heavily influenced and inspired by Kyle Simpson's book series 'You Don't Know JS'. The exercises here are more for my own personal use in my attempt to gain a deeper understanding of the innate asychrony of Javascript but feel free to peruse and try the exercises for yourself. Peace.
